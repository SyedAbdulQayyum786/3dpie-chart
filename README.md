# Three.js Pie Chart Frontend Design

This repository contains the frontend implementation of a **Three.js Pie Chart** design based on the provided requirements and reference models.

## Features

- **Interactive Pie Charts**: Two pie chart designs that replicate the reference 3d models (PieChart1.glb and PieChart2.glb).
- **Window Controls**:  
  - **Close** (`X`): Closes the form.  
  - **Minimize** (`-`): Collapses the chart into a flat box.  
  - **Maximize** (`[]`): Expands the chart to full-screen view.  
- **Draggable Window**: The pie chart box can be repositioned by dragging in its default or minimized states.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure for the pie charts and controls.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout for the charts and controls.
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering for creating the pie charts.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding backend integration for dynamic data rendering.
- Implementing animations for transitions between minimized, maximized, and default states.
